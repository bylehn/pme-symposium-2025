This slide summarizes our three key findings. First, we discovered that auxetic networks actually show benefits for acoustic bandgaps, particularly at low frequencies where the sharp angles enhance acoustic properties.

Second, we've achieved the first-ever demonstration of simultaneous optimization for both properties. We created networks with specific Poisson's ratios AND acoustic bandgaps at targeted frequencies - something never demonstrated before.

Third, we've gained precise control over the Poisson's ratio, reliably targeting values from -0.5 to 0.5. This gives us unprecedented control over mechanical properties and does it 100x faster than previous methods.

These three breakthroughs together open up entirely new possibilities for programmable metamaterials.

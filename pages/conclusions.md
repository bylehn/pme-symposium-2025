<!--
To summarize our findings: First, auxetic networks show benefits for acoustic bandgaps – their sharp angles enhance acoustic properties, particularly at low frequencies.

Second, we've achieved the first-ever demonstration of simultaneous optimization for both properties. We created networks with specific Poisson's ratios AND acoustic bandgaps at targeted frequencies.

Third, we've gained precise control over the Poisson's ratio, reliably targeting values from -0.5 to 0.5, and we do it 100x faster than previous methods.
These breakthroughs open entirely new possibilities for programmable metamaterials.

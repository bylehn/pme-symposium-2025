<!--
Here are our key results. On the left, you see networks optimized for negative Poisson's ratios - notice the sharp angles and re-entrant structures that create the auxetic behavior. On the right, positive Poisson's ratio networks have more open, cellular architectures. The amazing part? We can precisely control this behavior while simultaneously creating acoustic bandgaps. This level of control was previously impossible.

<!--
This chart shows something remarkable. Networks with negative Poisson's ratios - the auxetic ones - are actually MORE successful at creating acoustic bandgaps, especially at lower frequencies. This was unexpected! The sharp angles that enable auxetic behavior also help trap acoustic waves. It's like discovering that the same design feature that makes a material expand unusually also makes it better at blocking sound.

# Key Discoveries

<v-clicks>

- **Discovery 1**: Positive Poisson's ratio networks create wider bandgaps
  - Open cellular structures facilitate wave interference
  - Better for high-frequency applications

- **Discovery 2**: Auxetic networks maintain more stable bandgaps
  - Re-entrant structures resist deformation
  - Ideal for dynamic environments

- **Discovery 3**: Sharp angles (<30Â°) are crucial for auxetic behavior
  - Enables lateral contraction under compression
  - Creates natural acoustic resonators

- **Discovery 4**: Lower frequencies favor auxetic structures
  - Counter-intuitive finding with major implications
  - Opens new design possibilities

</v-clicks>

<!--
Let me highlight our four key discoveries. First, networks with positive Poisson's ratios create wider bandgaps due to their open architecture - great for high-frequency applications. Second, auxetic networks maintain more stable bandgaps under deformation - perfect for dynamic environments. Third, we found that angles sharper than 30 degrees are essential for auxetic behavior, and these same angles create natural acoustic resonators. Finally, and most surprisingly, lower frequency bandgaps actually work better in auxetic structures - a finding that contradicts conventional wisdom and opens entirely new design possibilities.

# Simultaneous Optimization Success

<!--
Here's the payoff - a material that does both things at once. Watch as this network is compressed. See how it contracts laterally? That's the negative Poisson's ratio. But look at the frequency response - the acoustic bandgap remains intact throughout the deformation. We've created a material that maintains its sound-blocking properties while exhibiting auxetic behavior. This opens doors to adaptive acoustic devices that we couldn't even imagine before.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### Advantages of Our Method

- Works with manufacturable disordered structures
- 100x faster optimization
- Simultaneous multi-property control
- Robust to manufacturing imperfections

<!--
Let's put our results in context. Previous methods using periodic lattices could create good acoustic properties but struggled with mechanical control. Other network approaches achieved good mechanical properties but limited acoustic performance. Our method excels at both, works with more realistic disordered structures, and does it 100 times faster. The ability to work with disordered structures is crucial - it means our designs are robust to the imperfections inherent in real-world manufacturing.

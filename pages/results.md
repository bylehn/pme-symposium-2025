  <p>Sharp angles (< 30Â°) that enable auxetic behavior also create natural acoustic resonators!</p>
</div>

<!--
Our results are remarkable. On the left, you see how different network structures create different behaviors - auxetic networks have sharp angles and re-entrant structures, while normal networks are more open. The surprising discovery? Auxetic networks are actually BETTER at creating acoustic bandgaps, especially at low frequencies. The same sharp angles that enable unusual mechanical behavior also trap sound waves effectively.

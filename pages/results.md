</div>

<!--
Our results are remarkable. On the left, you see how different network structures create different behaviors - auxetic networks have sharp angles and re-entrant structures, while normal networks are more open. The surprising discovery? Auxetic networks are actually BETTER at creating acoustic bandgaps, especially at low frequencies. The same sharp angles that enable unusual mechanical behavior also trap sound waves effectively.

<!--
Here's the payoff - watch this material in action. As it's compressed, it contracts laterally - that's the negative Poisson's ratio. But look at the frequency response - the acoustic bandgap remains intact! We've created a material that maintains its sound-blocking properties while exhibiting auxetic behavior. Compared to previous methods, we achieve excellent control of both properties, and we do it 100 times faster.

<!--
These images show our network optimization approach in action. We start with a disordered network - a 15√ó15 grid of nodes connected by springs with slight random perturbations. This is our initial playground for optimization.

In the middle image, you can see our AI optimization in progress. The red arrows show how the nodes are moving as the algorithm searches for the optimal configuration. This is where JAX's automatic differentiation makes all the difference.

The right image shows the final optimized network. Notice how it's developed subtle structural changes that give it the special properties we're targeting. The gray ghost image shows where the network started, highlighting the significant transformation.

The key breakthrough is using automatic differentiation from JAX. Traditional methods test one spring at a time - imagine having to tweak thousands of parameters one by one. Our approach optimizes all parameters simultaneously, giving us a 100x speedup. That's the difference between waiting days for results versus getting them in minutes.

  ## Our Innovation: Optimizing both properties without compromise

<!--
The real magic happens when we optimize for both properties simultaneously. We want a specific Poisson's ratio - how the material deforms - AND acoustic bandgaps - frequencies that can't pass through. It's like designing a car that's both fast AND fuel-efficient. Our algorithm balances these competing objectives through a clever loss function that minimizes deviation from both targets.
